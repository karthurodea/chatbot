*my chatbot was built on top of the scaffold html/css provided by the course instructor, Sonyl.
*my bot runs off a primary function containing a switch statement, where I defined 5 "input" cases, each with a conditional response.
*if the bot input matches any of the first three cases, a function is triggered to determine and output the response.
*case 4 and 5 respond with predefined text.
*my case functions will respond to the following inputs:
	1) "Hal, what day is Today?"
	2) "Hal, who is in the JSR-508 Class"
	3) "Hal, please elininate someone from the JSR-508 Class"
	4) "Thanks"
	5) any other inputs will trigger the response "Sorry, I can't help with that"
